# Hardware Subscription POC

Request specification:
  - `device_id`: Used to uniquely identify a device and check its
    subscription validity.
  - `device_nonce`: Random number generated at request time.  Prevents
    replay attacks by making each request-response pair unique.

Response specification:
  - `device_id`: Ensures response is tied specifically to this device.
  - `device_nonce`: The nonce that the device generated in its request.
  - `server_nonce`: A sequential nonce generated by the server that
    helps to prevent replay attacks.  If an attacker tries to replay
    an old response, the device will reject it because the
    `server_nonce` won't be incremented as expected.
